	- Equality assertion can test multiple-values as, for example:

	(assert-equal (values 1 2) (values 1 3)); => fails

	-  printed failed  test results  using "~s",  not "~a",  in format
	control string, when using default report style.

	- Cleaned sources;
	- improved tests progress output appereance in CCL and ABCL;
	- added the variable *test-output-stream*; the value must be an output
	  stream (default *standard-output*) where  all the tests results will
          be printed.
	- removing percetages for cumulative tests results
	  Rounding of  percentage can give,  for example, 100%  of passed
	  tests  when actually  a  few failed  or resulted  in  one or  more
	  errors;
	- added the variable *test-output-stream*; the value must be an output
	  stream (default *standard-output*) where  all the tests results will
	  be printed.

	- Fix documentation xml  file, adding conditions and documentation
	for run-suite-conditiion signal
        - Tabbify changelog
	- Switch the output of test suite information with signal

	02/08/2020
	Added a signal for test run failure. [jgodbout]

	15/04/2018
	Forked repository [cage]

	Redefined  methods  of	the  generic  function	EXPAND-FIXTURE	to
	specialize on the  test suite name instead of class  to solve some
	fringe cases with unintended effects. [THMG]

	17/11/12
	Reduced	 the  use  of  generic functions  internally,  now  its	 a
	combination of hash table lookups and stored objects.

	Added support for explicit function test dependency declarations.

	Added support for automatic re-run of failed tests via (RERUN-FAILED-TESTS)
	[THMG]

	18/11/12
	Added extra assertion test forms: ASSERT-EQUALITY and ASSERT-FAIL. [THMG]

	20/12/12
	Added  functions to  query various  information about  the defined
	test cases  and test suites e.g.  returning a list of  all defined
	test names. [THMG]

	03/01/13
	Defined	 a new	macro UNDEFFIXTURE  which  is used  to undefine	 a
	previously defined test suite fixture.

	Updated	 the  documentation  to	 include   a  new  entry  for  the
	UNDEFFIXTURE macro.

	Modified the default error reporting function so that it skips the
	detailed failure reports section if there is nothing to report.

	Tweaked the reporting of ASSSERT-TRUE to say 'Expected: (NOT NIL)'
	instead of 'Expected: T', since it expects a generalized boolean.

	BUGFIX: The  functions RUN-TEST and RERUN-FAILED-TESTS	were using
	the	undefined    variable	  *QUEUED-TESTS*    instead	of
	*QUEUED-TEST-REPORTS*
