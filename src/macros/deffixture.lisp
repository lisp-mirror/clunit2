The method EXPAND-FIXTURE now specializes on the test suite name instead of the class.
Consider the hierarchy shown below

(defsuite NumberSuite ())

(defsuite FloatSuite (NumberSuite))

(defsuite IntegerSuite (NumberSuite))

(defsuite BooleanSuite (FloatSuite IntegerSuite))

(deffixture IntegerSuite (@body)
  (let ((x 0) (y 1) (z 2))
    @body))

(deffixture FloatSuite (@body)
  (let ((x 0.0) (y 1.0) (z 2.0))
    @body))


(deftest test-bool1 (BooleanSuite)
  (assert-true  (< x y z))
  (assert-true  (= x y z) x y z))

Because BooleanSuite does not have a fixture but is a subclass
of both  FloatSuite and IntegerSuite When  TESTBOOL1 is called
inside the IntegerSuite the call

(expand-fixture (make-instance 'BooleanSuite) body)

actually end up calling the fixture expander

for the  FloatSuite because  FloatSuite is more  specific than
Integer suite!  So we will stick  to only using the suite name
and that will solve the problem.

(defmacro deffixture (suite (plug) &body body)
  "A fixture defines a code template that is wrapped around the code
of each test case and test  suite that are executed by test suite
SUITE  at  runtime.. The  test  case  body  is plugged  into  the
template at the position identified by PLUG.

Fixtures are expanded  at runtime, so the fixture  that will wrap
around a test depends on the test suite call stack."
  `(handler-bind ((warning #'muffle-warning))
     ;; Test that fixture is being defined for a SUITE subclass.
     (unless (get-test-suite ',suite)
       (error "~A is not a test suite." ',suite))
     (defmethod expand-fixture ((suite (eql ',suite)) body)
       (subst body ',plug '(progn ,@body)))))

  "Remove a fixture definition."
  `(remove-method #'expand-fixture
